‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Vercel)
The frontend is configured for easy deployment on Vercel.

Connect Your Git Repository:

Push your monorepo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

Create a new project on Vercel and import the repository.

Configure Project:

Framework: Vercel should auto-detect Vite.

Root Directory: Set this to apps/frontend.

Build Command: npm run build

Output Directory: dist

Set Environment Variables:

In the Vercel project settings, add the following environment variable:

VITE_API_URL = https://<your-gcp-backend-service-url>/api

vercel.json

A vercel.json file is included in the frontend directory  to ensure client-side routing (like react-router-dom) works correctly by redirecting all unknown paths to index.html.

Deploy:

Vercel will automatically build and deploy the frontend. The backend CORS policy has already been configured to allow requests from Vercel
